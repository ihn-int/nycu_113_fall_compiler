## How much time did you spend on this project

I spent roughly 12 hours on this project, not including wirting this report.

## Project overview

Describe the project structure and how you implemented it.

The project mainly consists of the lex program `scanner.l`. Since most of the work in the sample code is done, I only need to implement the regular expression and the corresponding rule parts.

These two part have nothing special. I just implemented the program based on the information on the github website. Because it passed the opened cases, I think it should have the capabilities requires by the specifications.

## What is the hardest you think in this project

I think the hardest part is to learn how to use the lex tool. It's a new thing for me. Though the slide is provided by the professor, I think it's not enough. I actually browsed other website to learn the lex tool.
